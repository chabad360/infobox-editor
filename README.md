# ITS Theme Infobox Editor

This plugin is designed to make it sane to edit data inside an [infobox](https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/Callouts/Callout+-+Infoboxes) by allowing you to edit the layout and content
in the same place (instead of changing to edit mode adding something and then changing the value in the properties).
